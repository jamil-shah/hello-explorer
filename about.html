    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth-largest 
      in the Solar System. Orbiting our planet at an average distance of 
      about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles), the Moon has a profound 
      influence on Earth’s tides and rotational stability. Its surface 
      is covered with craters, mountains, and vast plains formed by ancient 
      volcanic activity and meteorite impacts. With no atmosphere to protect 
      it, temperatures on the Moon can vary dramatically between day and night. 
      The Moon has inspired human exploration and scientific curiosity for 
      centuries, culminating in the historic Apollo missions that first brought 
      astronauts to its surface in 1969.</p>
